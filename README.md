# Many to Many Shortest Paths
This repo contains the source code for my bachelor thesis "Extending, Recombining and Evaluating Contraction Hierarchy based Many-to-Many Shortest Path Algorithms".

The bachelor thesis can be found [here](https://i11www.iti.kit.edu/_media/teaching/theses/ba_wieland22.pdf).

## Note
The code is not exactly the same as the one I used for my expermients during my bachelor thesis, as some code segments were provided to me.
I have replaced these parts in order to avoid any copyright infringement.
